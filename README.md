# FastAPI DevOps Project

This project demonstrates my proficiency in building, securing, containerizing, and deploying a modern web application using FastAPI. The goal is to showcase the end-to-end workflow of a DevOps Engineer, from application development to CI/CD pipeline implementation and cloud deployment. 

## Project Overview

The application is a simple FastAPI service that includes JWT-based authentication for securing API endpoints. This project is designed with scalability, security, and automated deployment in mind, using industry-standard DevOps practices.

## Key Features & Technologies

### 1. **FastAPI & JWT Authentication**
   - Developed a FastAPI application that serves API endpoints.
   - Secured endpoints using **JWT Authentication**, ensuring only authorized users can access protected resources.
   - Implemented authentication in Python using FastAPI's built-in support for OAuth2 and JWT tokens.

### 2. **Containerization with Docker**
   - Wrote a **multi-stage Dockerfile** to optimize both the build and runtime environments.
   - The application runs in an isolated Docker container, ensuring a consistent and portable deployment across different environments.
   - Successfully ran the FastAPI app inside Docker and exposed it via `uvicorn`.

### 3. **CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**
   - Implemented an automated CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to ensure that every code commit triggers a series of actions:
     - Build the Docker container.
     - Run tests (to be implemented next).
     - Deploy the application seamlessly.

### 4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - **Prometheus** is used to gather application metrics, which are visualized through **Grafana**, ensuring proactive monitoring and observability of the application's performance.
   - Added **custom logging** to monitor application behavior, making debugging and troubleshooting easier in production environments (next step in the project).

### 5. **Cloud Deployment on AWS**
   - Planned deployment on an **AWS EC2 instance**, where the application will run in a scalable cloud environment. This step will demonstrate the ability to manage infrastructure as code and deploy to cloud environments (coming soon).

### 6. **Security Best Practices**
   - JWT authentication ensures only verified users can access sensitive data.
   - Docker and AWS security groups are configured to minimize attack vectors and provide secure, scalable architecture.
